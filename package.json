  "description": "## ‚úíÔ∏èDescription  When thinking of an idea for the final project, I realized I should probably combine my passions of geography and travel to make a game I would want to play. I decided to come up with a country guesser game, based on the European continent. The game consists of a player who was to guess the correct filled in country. The player has a guess out of 4 options, and the game will have a timer going for how long it takes the player to play the game. The goal of the game is to guess all countries correctly. Failure to guess a country correctly will result in +5secs on the timer and a loss of a life. The player will have 5 lives, and will end the game once all 5 lives have been depleted. ## üïπÔ∏èGameplay",
