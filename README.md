## :question: Why this Project?

This project was created as part of a final project for my Game Programming course in my second to last semester of Computer Science at John Abbott College. The **goal of the game** is to correctly guess all the countries on the map! The idea of the game came to light when I decided it would be the most fun experience to combine my **passions** of **coding** and **travel/geography** into a unique and simple game to test and expand your geographical knowledge of these countries.

### :globe_with_meridians: Playing the Game

Finally, you now know the :electric_plug: **controls**, and the :gem: **game basics**, you're ready to start playing!

To start, you'll see the **map** with all countries colored in :white_circle: **white**, these are the countries that haven't yet been guessed. 

You'll also see a country colored in :large_blue_circle: **blue**, this is the country name you need to guess. On the left hand side of the screen, you'll see the country name options to guess from, you need to **correctly** guess the country that associates with the country in :large_blue_circle: **blue**. 

Once you guess a country, you will find out if you :white_check_mark: [**correctly guessed the country**](#white_check_mark-correctly-guessing-a-country) or if you :no_entry: [**incorrectly guessed the country**](#no_entry-incorrectly-guessing-a-country). 

You will **repeat** this process of guessing the country in :large_blue_circle: **blue** until you've finished the game!

If you're unsure of where or what the country it is, you can use a :bulb: **[hint](#bulb-hints)** to help you out. Watch out, you only have **10 hints** during the game!

If you **incorrectly** guess the country **3 turns** in a row, you'll sadly :heart: **[lose a life](#heart-losing-a-life)**. If you lose all 3 of your lives, the game will **end**, and you'll be a loser, so a pro tip, try not to do that!

You :trophy: **[win the game](#trophy-winning-the-game)** if you correctly guess all **60** countries on the map! 

You :x: **[lose the game](#x-losing-the-game)** if you lose all **3** of your **lives**, or if you **don't correctly** guess all 60 countries on  the map...

Well, that's all! This is a **fun**, **interactive**, and **brain challenging** game to **test and expand** your **geographical** **knowledge** of the world. I hope you have **fun**, and :star: **good luck**!

### :white_check_mark: Correctly Guessing a Country

When you **correctly** guess the country, a variety of things will happen. One of the first things you will notice is the **country color** on the map will turn from :large_blue_circle: **blue** to :green_apple: **green**, and the **country name** in the guess list will be filled :green_apple: **green**.

You will also notice a :page_facing_up: **text block** appear on the screen with a message indicating your success on the correct guess! 

Lastly, you will notice in the **game information** panel, the number of correct country guesses out of 60 will have gone **up by 1**. 

To **end the turn**, press the '**Enter**' key on your keyboard to move onto the **next country** to guess.

### :no_entry: Incorrectly Guessing a Country

When you **incorrectly** guess the country, a variety of things will happen. One of the first things you will notice is the **country color** on the map will turn from :large_blue_circle: **blue** to :red_circle: **red**, the **guessed country name** in the guess list will be filled :red_circle: **red**, and the **correct country name** in the guess list will be outlined in :green_apple: **green**.

You will also notice a :page_facing_up: **text block** appear on the screen with a message indicating you guessed the **wrong country**, what the **correct country name** was, and a small **information message**.

If you incorrectly guessed the country for the :three: **third time in a row**, you will :heart: **[lose a life](#heart-losing-a-life)** in the **game information** panel. Don't lose all **3** lives, or else you lose... 

To **end the turn**, press the '**Enter**' key on your keyboard to move onto the **next country** to guess.

### :bulb: Hints

During the game, you might have **no idea** what the name of the country to guess is, or, it might be **too small on the map** to properly see, you will need a **hint** to **help** figure out what the country name is.

To **use a hint**, you simply have to press on the '**H**' key on your keyboard, which will display a **message hint at the top of the screen**. You can only use **1** hint per turn, so this message will remain on the screen for **only 7 seconds**, so use it fast!

Once you use a hint during a turn, you will notice the **number of hints decrease by 1** in the **game information** panel.

Be mindful, you can only use a **total of 10 hints** throughout the game, use them **carefully**...

### :heart: Losing a Life

During the game, you might end up losing a life, you don't want that...

You **start** the game off with **3 lives**. You **lose a life** when you **incorrectly guess the country 3 times in a row**. You will visually see this loss in the **game information** panel, with **a heart** turning from :red_circle: **red** to :white_circle: **white**. 

If you **lose** all **3 lives**, you will :x: [**lose the game**](#x-losing-the-game).

### :hourglass: Timer

The timer is used to track **how much time** it takes you to **finish** the game. It's only purpose is to challenge you to win the game in at **least time** as possible! If the timer distracts you, don't worry about it, focus on **correctly guessing** all the countries (try not to get one wrong!). The timer is also used in the '**[Previous Records](#file_folder-previous-records)**' screen, showing on how much time it took you in that specific game.
