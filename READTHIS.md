# Project Proposal

## ‚úíÔ∏èDescription 
When thinking of an idea for the final project, I realized I should probably combine my passions of geography and travel to make a game I would want to play. I decided to come up with a country guesser game, based on the European continent. The game consists of a player who was to guess the correct filled in country. The player has a guess out of 4 options, and the game will have a timer going for how long it takes the player to play the game. The goal of the game is to guess all countries correctly. Failure to guess a country correctly will result in +5secs on the timer and a loss of a life. The player will have 5 lives, and will end the game once all 5 lives have been depleted.
## üïπÔ∏èGameplay

The game begins by the TitleScreenState, where the player will be able to choose a 'Play Game' option, which will take them to the CountrySelectionState, or a 'Previous Records' option, which would take them to a page showing record times and countries guessed. I also plan on implementing a similar background to that of Match 3, where it would show the game map, and at random times, a country would get filled in, while waiting for the player to select a choice. However, this would be an extra that I will implement, but maybe only after the submission date due to time constraints. 

Once the player goes into the game, they will be met with a couple of messages on how to play the game. They will then see that they have 5 lives, and a timer will start. The game will then transition into the CountrySelectionState, where the empty map will be shown, and a random country will be filled in Blue, alongside 4 option choices on the left hand side of the screen, indicating the country option choices. The Blue color indicates that it's the country the player is trying to guess. The player will either (haven't decided yet), use W & S to go between the country option choices, or will press 1,2,3, or 4, indicating the country choice. 

After the player chooses a country guess, if the guess is incorrect, the player will be taken to the IncorrectSelectionState. The player will lose a life, and the correct option will be shown. This will also will result in +5secs on the timer. The player can then press 'Enter' to continue to the next country guess (CountrySelectionState), and the country that they guessed incorrectly, will be colored in Red, indicating a wrong guess.

If the country guess is correct, the player will be taken to the CorrectSelectionState. The country will be filled in Green, representing a correct guess. A flagpole will also be planted on the correctly guess country. The game will then move onto the next country guess (CountrySelectionState). 

If the country to guess is the last country, and the player correctly guesses every country, they will be taken to the VictoryState. The VictoryState will show the time it took the player to guess all countries, the number of correctly guessed countries, and a cool message indicating success. The player will also have the option to 'Go to Main Menu', which would take them to the TitleScreenState, or a 'Play Again' option, which would take them into a new game.

If during the game, the player loses all their lives, they will be taken to the GameOverState, which would display the time the player played for, and the number of correctly guesses countries. The player will also have the option to 'Go to Main Menu', which would take them to the TitleScreenState, or a 'Play Again' option, which would take them into a new game.

Additionally, if time constraints allow (or after the submission date), I would like to implement a pause system, that would temporarily pause the game. I would also like to implement an optional reading of facts about a country when guessed.

## üßµ Wireframes

The below wireframes should give a very good understanding of how the game will look/feel. Some things might change in the end product however.

## TODO


## What I want to implement in the future

1. Particles that come from the correct panel
2. Collection of collected flags that you can view in the country selection
3. A simple pause system that will pause the game
4. Level system (easy, medium, hard) where the guess options will vary accordingly 
5. Screen that you can pop up to learn a fact about the country to guess
